This theme is based off of Ruthsarian's 'Skidoo Too" 3 column CSS layout:
http://webhost.bridgew.edu/etribou/layouts/skidoo_too/index.html

Converted to a XOOPS template by Technigrafa (xoops@technigrafa.com) on 8/2006

FEATURES:
1) Older browsers (< 5) will not get the CSS. This is by design because older browsers don't handle CSS well.
2) Design offers printer friendly stylesheet
3) Notifications, the user menu block and login block toggle on and off. This can be turned off in the stylesheet.
4) Font size can be adjusted by the 3 icons in the theme (uses some javascript and cookies)

KNOWN BUGS:
1) The Content Module's DHTML menu doesn't work in IE with this theme unless you use the replacement template that is included with this theme - IE doesn't like the float:left. Also, I modified the left column to have a z-index: 5 instead of 4 to keep the popup menus from going behind the center column. Not sure how that will affect things, but they appear to be alright. 
2) Although the HTML will validate by W3C, the CSS does not. Anyone want to help here?
3) For some REALLY strange reason, the left column will shift down if you use the <em> , <i> or <div style="font-style:italics"> tags in the left column. *scratches head*
4) The XOOPS calendar selector goes behind things. To fix this, edit /include/calendar-blue.css and add "z-index:5;" to the ".calendar, .calendar table" style.
5) When resizing the browser window too small (below ~820 pixels wide) the middle blocks were stacking with widths greater than 43%. At 43% they don't stack, but there is a greater gap between the blocks when stretched out on wider resolutions. 
CHANGELOG:
09/04/06: Updated "Fixed" theme to now be non-fixed and renamed theme to "skidoo2."
